<p>Write a JavaScript implementation of the game <a target="_top"

</p>

<p>Due: <span kkey="due_dates.pigDice">TBD</span></p>

<h2 class="listHeader">Objective</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Learn how to use closures to implement objects in JavaScript</li>
    <li>Learn to write unit tests in JavaScript.</li>
    <li>Obtain additional practice using JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="listHeader">Rules of the Game</h2>

<p>The goal is to be the first player to reach the target number of points (e.g., 100).</p>

<p>Players take turns. On his turn, a player may roll the die as often as he likes and calculates the total value of all
    the rolls. The total for a given turn is called the <em>point</em>. When he chooses to pass his turn
    (i.e., stop rolling), he adds the point to his current score. <em>However, </em> if at any time a player rolls a 1,
    his turn ends immediately, and he does not add any points to his total.</p>

<h2 class="listHeader">Details</h2>

<p>Implement the game Pig Dice in JavaScript and implement appropriate unit tests.</p>


<ol>
    <li>Your design should have at least two separate MVC triads:
        <ol type="a">
            <li>The first triad will be in charge of gathering the game's configuration information: player names and
                the target score. Ignore empty player fields (as opposed to creating players with no name.)
            <li>The second triad will be in charge of running the game itself.</li>
        </ol>
        The first triad will place a handler on the configuration form. That handler will create the second triad, hide
        the configuration window, and show the game board.
    </li>
    <li>Your triads should use good MVC or MVP design. In other words, the game logic should be separate from the code
        that interacts with your web page.
        <ul>
            <li> The "view" code interacts with your web page. It returns information from your page (e.g., reads forms)
                and updates your page (e.g., updates the score).
            </li>
            <li> The "model" code contains the game state and logic (e.g., keeps track of scores and whose turn it
                is).
            </li>
            <li>The controller or presenter "glues" the model and view together. In general, your event handlers are
                implemented here.
            </li>
        </ul>
        (Your game configuration triad doesn't need a model --- just a view and controller.)
    </li>
    <li>In addition to the triads, you should have separate <code>GameDie</code> and <code>Player</code> classes. These
        classes need not be triads.
    </li>
    <li>Each "model" class (including <code>GameDie</code> and <code>Player</code>) should have its own test suite. For
        this project, writing unit tests for the controller/presenter is optional.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 class="listHeader">Starter Code</h2>

<p>The git repository listed below contains extensive starter code. Cloning this repository will give you a directory
    structure and shells for all the main classes in the project. The directory structure will show you one way of
    organizing a large JavaScript project. The "shells" for the files will save you the time and effort of setting up
    all the MVC triads and JavaScript objects. The <code>pigDiceGame.html</code> shell will save you the trouble of
    loading all the different Java.</p>

<p>You are not required to use this starter code, but (1) it will save you a lot of time, and (2) it will help ensure
    you are using a good MVC/MVP design.</p>

<p>I suggest you begin with the <code>PigGameConfig</code> traid, because I've included the most starter code there.</p>

<!--
<h2>Sample Code</h2>

<p>The sample code for the course </p>

<p>The examples from Wednesday's lecture on Object Oriented Javascript are <a
        href="http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/~kurmasz/CS371/JavaScriptOO">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="canvasDemo.html">demo</a> showing how to use the HTML5 <code>canvas</code>. (Use of the canvas is
    optional.)</p>

-->

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>You must write Jasmine tests for each model class. To add new tests:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Add a new file to <code>jasmine/spec</code>.</li>
    <li>Add a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to <code>jasmine/SpecRunner.html</code> to include the new test.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="listHeader">Submission and Grading</h2>

<p class="listHeader">This assignment is worth 100 points allocated as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>50 points: Basic game functionality</li>
    <li>10 points: Configuration form functionality</li>
    <li>20 points: Software design (e.g., use of classes, use of MVC/MVP, etc.)</li>
    <li>10 points: Visual design</li>
    <li>10 points: Unit tests</li>
</ul>

<p>You will lose points if your code is not reasonably well formatted and documented.</p>

<em>Extra Credit</em>: Allow the user to add rows to the configuration screen to allow for more than four players.

<ul>
    <li>Demonstrate your application to the instructor</li>
    <li>Submit a <em>hard copy</em> of any relevant <code>html</code> and <code>javascript</code> files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Screen shots</h2>

<p>The two screen shots below represent a minimal-quality visual layout. I would grade these as 3/10.</p>
